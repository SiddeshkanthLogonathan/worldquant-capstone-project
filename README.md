# WorldQuant University Capstone Project: Deep Learning in Multi-period portfolio optimization

## Abstract

Multi-period portfolio optimization is an extension of the single-period MVO prob-
lem. Itâ€™s closer to the real deal since multi-period portfolio optimization takes different
time scales, transaction costs, time-varying return forecasts into consideration. Classi-
cal solution to the multi-period portfolio optimization is solving a convex optimization
problem. But with the reduction of computing costs and the rapid development of
artificial intelligence, leverage the deep learning methods in the multi-period portfolio
optimization problem is a possible alternative solution. In our paper, we apply deep
deep learning methods like neural network and deep reinforcement learning approach
to portfolio optimization under multi-period case and comparing the deep learning
approaches with the classical convex optimization approach.
